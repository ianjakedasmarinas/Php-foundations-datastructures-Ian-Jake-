# 📚 Digital Library Organizer (PHP Project)

🎯 Project Description:

This project is a simple PHP-based website that demonstrates three important computer science concepts — Recursion, Hash Table, and Binary Search Tree (BST) — using a Digital Library theme.
It shows how programming logic can organize and search for books just like a real library system.

 Purpose of the Project:

The main purpose of this project is to:

Help users understand how data structures work in PHP.

Show how books or categories can be organized efficiently.

Provide an easy-to-use web interface to explore each concept.

Combine learning and coding through a real-life example — a digital library.

 How to Run the Project:
Step 1: Install XAMPP

Download and install XAMPP on your computer.
Then, open the XAMPP Control Panel and click Start on Apache.

                                                                                      |

Descriptions:

**Main Page**       | A clean homepage with three boxes: Recursion, Hash Table, and BST. Each has a “Learn More” or “Open” button. 
 **Recursion Page**  | Displays nested categories like Fiction → Fantasy → Harry Potter.                                            
 **Hash Table Page** | Has a search box. When you type “Harry Potter”, it shows book details.                                       
|**BST Page**        | Lists book titles alphabetically and shows “Found!” or “Not Found” when searching.
